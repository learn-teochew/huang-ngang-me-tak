Transcriptions of Teochew programs from 《方言夜读》
==============================================

[《方言夜读》](https://chinese.cri.cn/media/audio/fyyd/index.shtml) is a radio program from China Radio International (CRI). They broadcast in four languages: Cantonese, Hakka, Hokkien, and Teochew. The program is usually less than 5 minutes long and consists of a short story or piece, often translated from a Mandarin original.

The website has Mandarin text for each program, but the Teochew version can be quite different from the text and shows how written Chinese (Mandarin) is translated on-the-fly when reading in Teochew and other dialects. Here I have transcribed the Teochew version in the `dieghv` romanization.
